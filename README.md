# NPCP bias correction intercomparison

This repository contains code and information relating to the
National Partnership for Climate Projections (NPCP) bias correction intercomparison project.

Phase 1 of the intercomparison is now complete.

There might be an opportunity for a second phase of the intercomparison.
Ideas for that phase are being collected at https://github.com/AusClimateService/npcp/issues/3.

## Information for interested parties

A report on Phase 1 of the intercomparison will be submitted to the Journal of Southern Hemisphere of Earth System Science,
to be included in a special issue relating to the Australian Climate Service.
In the meantime, the report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/npcp/blob/master/reports/phase1/phase1_report.md).

## Information for participants

### Data access

Input data used in the bias correction process (i.e. model outputs and observational data products) and
output data produced by the various bias correction methods used in the study
are being hosted by project ia39 on NCI. 

Researchers participating in the intercomparison project can request access to ia39 at:  
https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ia39

### Input data specifications (time periods, spatial grid, etc)

Daily timescale input data is provided for the 1960-2019 and 2060-2099 periods.
Model data corresponds to the CMIP6 historical experiment from 1960-2014 and ssp370 for 2015 onwards. 

Each input data file has been pre-processed (using the `preprocess.py` script in this repository)
in order to ensure common:
- File metadata (e.g. variable names)
- Data units
- Spatial grid (`NPCP-20i`) 

The `NPCP-20i` grid is a 0.2 degree lat/lon grid
with the same spatial extent as the AWRA data (44S-10S, 112E-154E),
which is the input dataset with the smallest spatial extent.
The `preprocess.py` script uses [xESMF](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
conservative regridding, which is the
[recommended method](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Compare_algorithms.html)
when upscaling from higher to lower horizontal resolution
(the original observational and downscaled model data is all higher resolution than 0.2 degrees).

### Input data availability

Unless otherwise stated, the traffic lights in the following table
summarise the availability of `pr`, `tasmax` and `tasmin` data.

| driving model | downscaling model | 1960-2019* | 2060-2099 |

### Bias correction tasks (phase 1)

Researchers who are interested in participting in the intercomparison project
(i.e. by applying their bias correction method/code)
are required to complete the tasks described below.

In order write your bias corrected data files to `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/`
(following the data reference syntax described above),
you'll need to apply for access to the
NCI project ia39 writers group (ia39_w) at the following link:  
https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ia39_w

Phase 1 of the intercomparison focuses on daily timescale
`tasmax`, `tasmin` and `pr` data on the `NPCP-20i` grid.
For each variable and downscaling model there are 5 tasks to complete...

For the downscaled CMIP6 data (ACCESS-ESM1-5, CESM2 and EC-Earth3) the tasks are:  
- **Task 1 (Historical)**: Produce bias corrected data for the 1980-2019 period, using 1980-2019 as a training period.
- **Task 2 (Projection)**: Produce bias corrected data for the 2060-2099 period, using 1980-2019 as a training period.
- **Task 3 (Cross validation)**: Produce bias corrected data for the 1990-2019 period, using 1960-1989 as a training period.

For the downscaled ERA5 data the tasks are:  
- **Task 4 (Historical)**: Produce bias corrected data for the 1980-2019 period, using 1980-2019 as a training period.
- **Task 5 (Cross validation)**: Produce bias corrected data for the 2000-2019 period, using 1980-1999 as a training period.

An additional **documentation** task involves submitting a pull request to this repo
to add a summary of how your bias correction method works
and the details/location of code used to implement it to the [methods](https://github.com/AusClimateService/npcp/tree/master/methods) subdirectory. 

The training data for each variable is archived at `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/`
following the data reference syntax described above.
For example, to complete tasks 1-3 for ACCESS-ESM1-5 data downscaled using BARPA
the observational and model data you'll need is at:
```
/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/pr/observations/AGCD/raw/task-reference/
/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/pr/CSIRO-ACCESS-ESM1-5/BOM-BARPA-R/raw/task-reference/
```
Check the input data availability table above for an indication of
which combinations of downscaling and parent models are available.

Bias corrected data files written to `ia39` for each task should look something like the following examples:
1. `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/tasmax/CSIRO-ACCESS-ESM1-5/UQ-DES-CCAM-2105/ecdfm/task-historical/tasmax_NPCP-20i_CSIRO-ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp370_r6i1p1f1_UQ-DES-CCAM-2105_v1_day_19800101-20191231_ecdfm-AGCD-19800101-20191231.nc`
2. `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/tasmax/CSIRO-ACCESS-ESM1-5/UQ-DES-CCAM-2105/ecdfm/task-projection/tasmax_NPCP-20i_CSIRO-ACCESS-ESM1-5_ssp370_r6i1p1f1_UQ-DES-CCAM-2105_v1_day_20600101-20991231_ecdfm-AGCD-19800101-20191231.nc`

4. `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/tasmax/ECMWF-ERA5/UQ-DES-CCAM-2105/ecdfm/task-historical/tasmax_NPCP-20i_ECMWF-ERA5_evaluation_r1i1p1f1_UQ-DES-CCAM-2105_v1_day_19800101-20191231_ecdfm-AGCD-19800101-20191231.nc`
5. `/g/data/ia39/npcp/data/tasmax/ECMWF-ERA5/UQ-DES-CCAM-2105/ecdfm/task-xvalidation/tasmax_NPCP-20i_ECMWF-ERA5_evaluation_r1i1p1f1_UQ-DES-CCAM-2105_v1_day_20000101-20191231_ecdfm-AGCD-19800101-19991231.nc`

The files have the same reference syntax as the input files with an additional field
after the final `_` indicating the bias correction method, observational dataset
and the start and end time for the training period.
