## Results

Results from the intercomparison will be progressively added to this directory.
The basic idea is that there's a separate jupyter notebook displaying results for each different evaluation metric.

The evaluation metrics calculated here, are for the most part a combination of the evaluation metrics used in Vogel et al. (2023) and Schroeter et al. (2023; Manuscript in preparation).

We're keeping track of the metrics still to come [here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/npcp/issues/8).
If you'd like to contribute a notebook for a particular metric or suggest a new metric,
you can open an issue to discuss [here](https://github.com/AusClimateService/npcp/issues).
